# Cherry MX Stem Keycap Mould

This is an OpenSCAD design keycap mould for producing resin keycaps. Most of 
the work here is credit to rsheldiii on thingiverse.com (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:468651) 
for creating the original OpenSCAD parametric keycap mould. All I've really
done around this so far is to make a mould out of it :)

## Success

Please note: at this point I have not had any trials of actually moulding a keycap in this mould. I will rectify this as soon as possible now that my new resins have arrived ^_^. 

## Usage

This mould is intended for use with 2-part resins but should also work for 
creating artisans on as well. Firstly, cover the mould in mould release,
probably pva or wax release will work best in this scenario. Make sure to cover the stem mould extremely well as this will probably be a pain to remove anyway. 

The mould should be held together and filled through the central hole in the bottom. If all goes well, the air should escape through the other holes and leave little work to do at the end to clean up the cast part.
